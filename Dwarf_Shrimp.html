					<b><p>Although an aquarium dedicated to something as seemingly boring as tiny shrimp may not be everyone’s cup of tea, the (dwarf) shrimp hobby is growing fast. Knowledge about their existence and care is spreading and exciting color varieties are being developed. The excitement of breeding and watching these tiny creatures grow is part of the hobby, and it’s not hard to see why many are drawn to it. Whether you’re looking to start a miniature shrimp tank or upgrade your current setup, an aquarium dedicated to dwarf shrimp can be a rewarding and fun experience.

		<h2>Tank and water parameters:</h2>
		</div>
		
			<p>	More and more aquarists are giving shrimp keeping a try; if you are, too, keep reading for more information about setting up an aquarium for Neocaridina and Caridina species like Cherry shrimp, Bee shrimp and Crystal reds.

When setting up an aquarium for Neocaridina and Caridina shrimp, the most important thing to consider is water parameters. Shrimp require softer, more acidic water than many other aquarium inhabitants, so it is important to make sure the pH is between 6.5 and 7.5, and the water hardness is between 0 and 8 dGH. Setting up a sponge filter, or using a filter that has a slow flow rate, will help keep the water clean and stable while not stirring up too much debris. 

Additionally, shrimp prefer heavily planted tanks with plenty of hiding places and soft, sandy substrate. Live plants are ideal, as they provide oxygen and help create a natural environment for the shrimp. Adding driftwood and rocks can also provide additional hiding spots, as well as beneficial tannins to the water. Adding Indian almond leaves to the aquarium can also help to lower the pH and add beneficial tannins. 

Finally, it is important to feed the shrimp a varied diet of high-quality commercial food, as well as supplemental foods like blanched vegetables, algae wafers, and frozen foods. Regular water changes are also important to keep the water clean and stable.
		</p>

		<p>
			
		A temperature between 70 °F/21 °C and 77 °C/25 °C should be suitable for almost all dwarf shrimp species, although some can withstand a much wider range. Higher temperatures lead to a faster life cycle, which means quicker growth and more breeding but also a much shorter life span. The preferred pH is not the same for all dwarf shrimp varieties, but something between 6-7 should be fine for most.
		</p>
			<b>Things you might need:</b><ul>

				<li><b>Filter.</b> Because shrimp may get stuck in powerful filters, it’s a good idea to use a filter that can be equipped with a filter guard.</li>


				<li><b>Heater.</b> Although some shrimp do well in room temperature water, a heater protects them from sudden fluctuations.</li>


				<li><b>Thermometer.</b> To spot heater malfunctions and other temperature issues right away, a thermometer is very important.</li>


				<li><b>Water testing kit.</b> A test kit like this one is a must! As explained below, shrimp are very vulnerable to bad water quality.</li>

				<li><b>Water conditioner</b> if chlorine is used in your tap water.</li>

		<h2>tank set-up and tankmates:</h2>
		</div>
			
			<p>
				Setting up your aquarium in such a way that it makes an ideal habitat for dwarf shrimp is not too difficult. There are a few things to think about: hiding places/plants, tankmates and substrate.

Hiding places/plants: Dwarf shrimp need plenty of hiding places and plants in their tank to feel safe and secure. Live plants are ideal, as they also provide oxygen for the tank. Driftwood, rocks and other decorations can also be used to provide hiding places.

Tankmates: Dwarf shrimp are a peaceful species, so they should be kept with other compatible species. Some suitable tankmates include small fish, snails, and other dwarf shrimp.

Substrate: A soft substrate is ideal for dwarf shrimp, as they like to feed off of it. Gravel or sand both work well, and can be mixed with plant substrate to provide more nutrition. A substrate heater can also be added to the tank to provide a more stable temperature.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Hiding places & plants –</b> If you’ve kept shrimp before, you’ve no doubt noticed that they really appreciate a few hiding spots and will often hang out in or around them. This is especially important when they’re molting, as they will be a bit more vulnerable and prefer a dark, safe spot. Even if you keep your shrimp tank mostly empty, a few hiding spots are necessary. Fortunately, aquarium plants are perfect for this. They offer several advantages, including making shrimp feel safer, which lowers stress, and allowing shrimp to feed on plants. The aquarium will seem lovely and natural thanks to the plants, which will also help maintain steady water values. Shrimp caves made of ceramic are a fantastic and frequently utilized alternative to hiding places.

Some of the best hiding places for shrimp include:

• Driftwood and rocks: Driftwood, rocks, and other types of decorations are some of the best hiding spots for shrimp. They will hide under, between, and around them.

• Plants: Java moss, Anubias, and other low-light, low-tech plants are great for shrimp. They can hide among the leaves and stems and also graze on the algae that may form on them.

• Breeding Boxes: If you’re looking to breed your shrimp, a breeding box is the perfect hiding spot. These boxes are designed specifically to give shrimp and eggs a safe, dark place to hide.

• Filter Intake and Outtake: Many shrimp will also hide near the intake and outtake of your filter. This is a great place for them to hide and get food that may be caught in the filter.

			<p>
				<b>Tankmates –</b> If you’re interested in keeping more than just shrimp, keep in mind that the average Neocaridina/Caridina setup is a bit too small for most tankmates. Almost all fish will also catch and eat shrimp fry or even adult dwarf shrimp, which isn’t really what you want when you’re trying to establish a large colony or keep one of the more expensive types.
				If you want to keep your shrimp 100% safe, stick to a single species aquarium or maybe a few snails. Otocinclus species  are also known for being very peaceful. Dwarf shrimp species that are relatively cheap and reproduce quickly enough, such as cherry shrimp, should do relatively well in densely planted peaceful community aquariums. Compatible tankmates for dwarf shrimp are  peaceful fish such as guppies, rasboras and small tetras.

It is important to remember that while some species may be peaceful and compatible with dwarf shrimp, they may still be too large or territorial to be kept in the same aquarium. When selecting tankmates for dwarf shrimp, it is important to do research on their size, temperament, and compatibility with other fish. For example, some larger fish may eat the shrimp, so it is important to ensure that you avoid these species when stocking your tank. Additionally, some larger fish may also be too aggressive for the dwarf shrimp, so it is important to ensure that you only choose tankmates that are peaceful and compatible with the shrimp.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Substrate – </b>Your choice of substrate mostly depends on the type of dwarf shrimp you’re interested in keeping. For the more hardy species such as cherry shrimp, regular sand, fine gravel or even a bare bottom setup are all fine. For more sensitive species such as crystal red shrimp, you’ll want to use a high quality aquarium soil. This will provide them with essential minerals and nutrients. 

Some species, however, have more specific pH and water hardness requirements and your substrate can help you achieve their preferred range. Some of these active substrates will help keep the water slightly acidic (low pH). Others, such as crushed corals, will do the opposite and help keep the water more alkaline. This is great for shrimp that prefer a higher pH, such as Sulawesi shrimp. 

No matter what type of shrimp you’re keeping, you’ll want to make sure you thoroughly clean and rinse your substrate before adding it to the tank. This will help make sure you don’t introduce any unwanted chemicals or debris that could harm your shrimp.

		<h2>Dwarf shrimp diet:</h2>
		</div>
			<p>
			Not all dwarf shrimp species require the same diet and care, but there are definitely some guidelines that apply to all of them! In general, dwarf shrimp species like to have a variety of foods available to them, such as algae wafers, blanched vegetables, and frozen or freeze-dried foods.
